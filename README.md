# CSS Demo

## Background

This is a demo of various CSS effects and layouts.

## Functionality & MVP  

- [ ] Navbar attach on scroll down (navbar that snaps to the top and replaces initial navbar)
- [ ] grid/col system (like bootstrap col-sm/col-md/col-lg designed to be reactive to different view sizes)
- [ ] Rotation (3D, 2D rotation of "tiles")
- [ ] Modal (lightbox/modal)
- [ ] Flip Card (cards that flip on click)

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] A production Readme
- [ ] Show/hide for code views

## Wireframes

This website will be laid out simply with sections for each feature that I would like to present. There will be two navbars to demostrate attach on scroll down. I will create a simple layout inspired by other CSS demos. However, the attach on scroll navbar will differentiate the look of my site.
